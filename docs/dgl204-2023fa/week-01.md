# Intro to Kotlin
---
Hey! We're going to learn Kotlin! In particular, we're going to learn the use of Kotlin for the development of mobile apps. As general-purpose programming language, Kotlin can be used for pretty much anything, but it's main use these days is as the language of choice for Android app development. However, Kotlin probably isn't your first programming language, and I'm going to assume you have some programming background already, probably with a statically-typed programming language.
## Static vs dynamic typing

## Key resources
### Kotlin Docs
The official [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) site covers everything that you might need to know about Kotlin. Watch the video below to see how we'll use the docs.

### LearnCS.online
[LearnCS.online](https://www.learncs.online) is web-based course for new programmers developed by Geoffrey Challen at the University of Illinois. The work Geoffrey and his team has done to develop this course is phenomenal, and Geoffrey has ensured that the course is open and free for anyone to use.

### Kotlin by Example
[Kotlin by Example](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview) is "an official set of small and simple annotated examples designed for those new to Kotlin". Although many of these examples leave out more details than we'd like, this is an excellent resource, and can be used for review and practice.

# Homework and activities

## Programming challenges 1
Follow the directions below to access the first set of programming challenges and complete them according to the directions. Note that this first set of "challenges" are intended to be *very* easy; if you have any trouble understanding what is required, or in completing the challenges, reach out to me as soon as possible so that we can correct your understanding and/or process *early*, before the course becomes more difficult.

### To access the programming challenges:
1. 

### Documentation and commenting
After you have completed all of the above write a short reflection in the GitHub repository that contains your report. You can reflect on any of the above that you like, for example you can talk about what you found interesting, or what you found challenging, or what surprised you. A good approach is to consider what you didn't understand; in your reflection you can discuss what you think you might be able to do to improve your understanding.

Your reflection should be at least a paragraph (3 - 5 well formed sentences) in your own words. If your having any trouble with the reflective process, you can ask me for a bit of help, or you can check out our [Resources](dgl204-2022fa/resources.md) page for support.
