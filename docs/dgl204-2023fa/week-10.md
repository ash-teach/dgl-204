# Coroutines and concurrency
---

In week 10 we take a deeper look at [coroutines and concurrency](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html). [Coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) are popular solution to [concurrent programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)) models and have been supported in Kotlin by the official [Coroutines library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/) since 2018.

Your work this week is primarily focused on the completion of an offical JetBrains tutorial, called the [Coroutines and channels](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-and-channels.html) tutorial. This tutorial includes starter code and directly demonstrates the pros and cons of different models of concurrent programming, including [callbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) and [futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) (or promises).

**Fair warning**: This is complex topic and a complex tutorial. The videos I've provided below I hope shed some light on what is expected of you and how to proceed. I do recommend tackling this one piece by piece though - take time between sections to let your brain rest and reflect on what you've learned. Don't hesitate to reach out if you run into any problems or issues along the way.

In terms of timeline: Completing this tutorial sooner will set you up more effectively for the upcoming project 2, but you can take it slower: since there is no associated homework, you don't necessarily need to have the tutorial done by week 11.

Check out the two videos below for an overview of the resources available and of the tutorial proper!

# Homework and activities

There is no assigned homework this week other than to complete the tutorial above. Take your time with the content and make sure you understand it to the best of your ability. I definitely encourage experimentation with the code!
