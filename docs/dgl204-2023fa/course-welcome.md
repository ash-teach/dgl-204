# Welcome to DGL 204 Programming for Mobile App Development!
Welcome to the course! On this site you will find links to all course resources and direction on how to approach your work each week, and for each course assignment. Course videos, which will provide additional direction and details, will be hosted exclusively on the course [Brightspace site](https://mycourses.nic.bc.ca/d2l/home).

The first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with what is available to you on this site - did you know this is actually a [GitHub pages site](https://github.com/ash-teach/dgl-204)? It's built using [Paul Hibbitts'](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/) excellent [Docsify Open Multicourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit), an open source project you can fork yourself, if you like. For students enrolled in DGL 204 at North Island College you *should* view this course through [Brightspace](https://mycourses.nic.bc.ca/d2l/home), but you can check it out [directly on the web]((https://github.com/ash-teach/dgl-204)), if you wish.

If you're entirely new to Brightspace you might want to check out some of the resources on [LearnAnywhere](https://learnanywhere.opened.ca/), North Island College's site devoted to student support for online learning. There is a whole section devoted to [Brightspace](https://learnanywhere.opened.ca/digital-technologies/brightspace/) that might be of help if you run into any trouble navigating the interface.

Once you've familiarized yourself with the course site and contents you should read the [syllabus](https://mycourses.nic.bc.ca/d2l/le/lessons/11972/topics/361422) and watch the course welcome videos. Then it's time to start installing software! See the [Required Software](#required-software) section below, and watch the video if you need a bit of help.

The first week of course content will be released on **Wednesday Sept. 6th** so keep an eye on your Brightspace notifications for updates.

I'm really excited about this course and what we're going to accomplish this semester! 

 
 # Required Software

* [IntelliJ IDEA - The Community Edition (CE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is free and sufficient for our needs; however, with a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (highly recommended!) you can download the Ultimate version for free. Note that the campus lab computers have version 2023.2.1 of the Community Edition installed; you should consider installing that version or later. You might also consider installing the EduTools plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - The current stable release is version 2022.3.1, the same version that is installed on the campus lab computers. You may install a later version if you wish, but I recommend sticking with the latest stable.
* A GitHub client - The campus lab computers have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed. My personal preference is to use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/), for which you can also receive a free Pro license if you register for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
