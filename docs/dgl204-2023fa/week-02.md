# A deeper look at some Kotlin-specific language features
---
We're continuing our review of fundamentals this week, with an eye towards some more uniquely Kotlin (or, at least, *not* Java) features of the language. Our main focus this week is some basic object-oriented programming syntax (to be expanded on in *much* more detail in weeks to come) and Kotlin `string`s and string manipulation. We'll also take a look at some things that are likely new to you, and need to be introduced early, but don't really fit under any other topic heading, namely: destructuring (a *very* useful tool!) and `null` safety (an extremely important topic!)

# Kotlin core development and evolution

## Kotlin history and evolution
Kotlin is a young, but constantly evolving language. If you want to learn a bit about Kotlin's history, you can check out the [Kotlin Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)), also did you know Kotlin is [named after an island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_Island)? Kinda like [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java). [Or maybe not...](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2077265/so-why-did-they-decide-to-call-it-java.html)?

Anyway, despite Kotlin being a young language it's garnered a lot of interest and a pretty massive following. Likely in large part due to [Google's first-class support of Kotlin for Android development](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/). The broader [Kotlin community](https://kotlinlang.org/community/) provides a significant level of support in the form of [feature proposals](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/tree/master/proposals), [feature development](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/contribute.html#contribute-to-the-compiler-and-standard-library), [user testing](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/contribute.html#participate-in-early-access-preview), [documentation and tutorials](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/contribute.html#contribute-to-the-documentation), and [bug reporting and fixes](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/pulls).

Major decisions relating to the language are handled by the core Kotlin [Language Committee](https://kotlinfoundation.org/structure/) and the Lead Language Designer, [Roman Elizarov](https://github.com/elizarov). Decisions are guided by three principles outlined in the [Kotlin Evolution](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-evolution.html) documentation. They are:
* **Keep the language modern over the years.**
* **Stay in the constant feedback loop with the users.**
* **Make updating to new versions comfortable for the users.**

## The Kotlin roadmap and future development
The cool thing about Kotlin (and other open source languages that are developed transparently) is that you can get in on the ground floor of both development and testing. You can always sign up for the [early access preview](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/eap.html) to try out new features before they're fully ready for primetime, or you can keep abreast of planned upcoming feature changes via the [Kotlin Docs - Roadmap](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/roadmap.html) and the associated [YouTrack Kotlin Roadmap](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/agiles/153-1251/current). The following videos present the Kotlin roadmap and YouTrack board:
