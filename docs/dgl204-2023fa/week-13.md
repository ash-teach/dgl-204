# Course wrap-up
---
Congrats on completing the course! I have a final few words and some advice to share to help you with your future endeavours in programming.

## Some advice

### 1. Be bold and contribute!
The best way to get better at anything at all is to practice it; further to that, the best way to ensure you practice is to do it in the open! If you haven't looked recently, take some time over the Christmas break to revisit some open source communities you may have previously visited - or new ones entirely. **Get excited about development** and think about how you can support your own, or others', learning through contributions.

If you like this idea, but you feel nervous about it, find some low-hanging fruit to start with: The [GitHub good-first-issue topic](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue) collects issues and bugs tagged as `good-first-issue`s in open projects that you could potential sink your teeth into. Or check out the [Community Exchange](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/exchange) on GitHub Education, a forum for students to post projects to be shared and collaborated on with other students - and it's pretty active!

### 2. Start a personal project
 One of the best ways to stay sharp is to keep a personal project on the go. While this might be a tall order for those of you who are registered in full-time courses (or particularly demanding courses) and/or work outside your studies, keep in mind that a personal project doesn't have to be a particularly difficult or complex one. In fact, I *highly encourage* you to start very simple make your first personal project a recreation of a simple app that *you already use*. That way, you don't have to worry about the design, or the features, you need only reproduce what already works well. 

The benefit is two fold:
1. You keep your skills sharp by applying what you've learned (and perhaps a bit more); 
2. Having a personal project will keep you energized about coding.

The second point is critical, but it takes some discipline. We've all been in the situation before where when in the middle of some project (likely homework) you feel as though you would much rather be doing something else... Well, if you can make that "something else" a personal project that will serve to continue to support your learning, it can be *highly* valuable. Beyond that, if you either make a schedule to allow yourself personal project development time on only in small chunks, or perhaps only when you need the break from homework, it can serve to give your brain a rest from the necessary tasks while still increasing your capacity for development work. 

To be fair, this isn't for everyone. But if you think it sounds at all like it might be a help to you - give it a try!

## Advent of Code 2023!
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a great event that runs every December. Many coders use it as an opportunity to learn a new language or to sharpen skills in an existing language. The community around it is fantastic and it's pretty exciting to try a new challenge every day. If you participate, I recommend you post your solutions as a public repository on GitHub.

## Online learning resources
As you are well aware [LearnCS.online](https://www.learncs.online/) and other [official JetBrains sites](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview) are excellent resources when it comes to learning more about Kotlin. In particular, much of the last third of LearnCS.online is relevant if you ever take a course like [CPS 101](https://calendar.nic.bc.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=3&coid=3536).

Other resources you might find useful are [Google CodeLabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) and especially the [codelabs focussing on Android development](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?product=android). 

If you're interested in keeping in touch with the world of Kotlin then the official [Kotlin Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/) and the official [JetBrains Kotlin YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin) are excellent resources that will keep you connected with the latest Kotlin updates and with the latest in development strategies. There are plenty of other [Kotlin community outlets](https://kotlinlang.org/community/) as well, if you prefer to connect via platforms like Slack, Reddit, or StackOverflow, to name a few.
