> ## Important Reminders
> * Homework 4 is due today - Oct. 24th. If you're a bit behind please aim to get this in soon, as I'd like to get feedback to you as soon as possible.
> * Advent of Code 2 is due _officially_ Nov. 7th, but I _recommend_ trying to get it in early, if possible. Oct. 31st would be a good target, if you can achieve it, but the 7th is fine too.
> * Homework 5 is due on Oct. 31st, next Monday, at 11:59pm
