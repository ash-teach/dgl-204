> ## Important Reminders
> * Homework 5 is due Oct. 31st.
> * Advent of Code 2 is due _officially_ Nov. 7th, but I have previously _recommended_ trying to get it in early, if possible. Any time between not and Nov. 7th would be great, if you can achieve it, but the 7th is fine too.
> * Homework 6 is due on Nov. 7th, next Monday, at 11:59pm
